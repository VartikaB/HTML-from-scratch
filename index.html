    <p>Hey everyone this is your tutor <b>Vartika</b><br/><hr/></p>
    <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
   
    <h3 id="editor">Without further a do Let's select a suitable code editor for out<b>HTML Projects</b></h3>
    <p>HTML can be edited in a notepad(Windows,Linux) or Text Edit(Mac).Using a simple notepad is not a good idea as we will have to face allignment problems and the code is readable but not attractive for users to keep motivated. I thereby recommend for<b>VS CODE</b>editor or<b>Sublime</b>. There are various other code editors too. This should be kept in mind that a code editor completely depends on the user.The code editor with which you are comfortable with will keep you motivated.</p>

    <h3>HTML Documents</h3>
    <p>All HTML documents must start with a document type declaration: <b id="bold">&#60!DOCTYPE html&#62</b>.</p>

    <p>    The HTML document itself begins with <b id="bold">&#60html&#62</b> and ends with <b id="bold">&#60/html&#62</b>.</p>
        
    <p>   The visible part of the HTML document is between <b id="bold">&#60body&#62</b> and <b>&#60/body&#62</b>.</p>
    <h3>The &#60!DOCTYPE&#62 Declaration</h3>
    
    <p>The &#60!DOCTYPE&#62 declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.</p>
        
    <p>   It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any HTML tags).</p>
        
    <p>   The &#60!DOCTYPE&#62 declaration is not case sensitive.</p>
        
    <p>  The &#60!DOCTYPE&#62 declaration for HTML5 is:</p>
    <h3>HTML Headings</h3>
    <p>HTML headings are defined with the &#60h1&#62 to &#60h6&#62 tags.</p>
    <p>&#60h1&#62 defines the most important heading. &#60h6&#62 defines the least important heading: </p>
